# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

**Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Project**  
Hosted by Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway

---

## Overview

This project simulates a real-time pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots using machine learning, economic intuition, and real-time data processing.

Static pricing leads to inefficiencies in utilization. Our goal is to build dynamic models that adjust parking prices intelligently based on demand, traffic, vehicle types, and competition.
